# Why and What?
#### Everyone has (or had) a blog

For years, whenever I had an idea that I could expand on, write about and share, I just forgot about them. This, I think may be one of the largest drivers for people to start blogging, tumblring, tweeting. I finally decided to give it a go myself.

My interests are varied but most have at least ties to technology and specifically programming. Having learned the skill at a young age, it has shaped my world more than I dare to think about. It has provided me with jobs, income, and a hobby, pastime, and an identity. Imagining who I would have become without my dad having introduced me to the ABC 80, is difficult at best.
