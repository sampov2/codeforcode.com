This is a quick and dirty squarespace to jekyll conversion. I never post or change anything on the site, so it made no sense for me to keep paying for it.

## Install deps

```shell
sudo gem install bundler jekyll
sudo bundle install
```

## Serve in dev mode

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Build site

```shell
bundle exec jekyll build
```
