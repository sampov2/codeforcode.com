NOTE, editor's note: the app has since been unpublished.

My [favorite local radio in Helsinki](http://www.radiohelsinki.fi/) underwent major reconstructive surgery about one month ago now. The channel changed ownership, studios, it's FM channel, and most of it's programming. While this post is not about the qualitative shift in the channel's content, it's appropriate to mention that so far I have slightly scattered feelings about the change. Mostly scattered on the positive side though, I'm happy to say!

The change brought with it a revamp of their website with some unexpected side effects: I was no longer able to play their stream on Android.

For some time now, I've wanted to experiment with mobile app development. I recently noticed an [article on a chromium project](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/01/run-chrome-apps-on-mobile-using-apache.html) to provide a robust toolchain and workflow for creating mobile applications using web technologies. Having these tools come by at the same time when I had a proper need to fill, finally pushed me to [release my first Android app](http://codeforcode.com/blog/2014/2/11/cordova-android-angularjs-heart).

Say Hello to [Radio Helsinki Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeforcode.radiohelsinki)!

The app allows you to stream Radio Helsinki on your mobile device. In addition to the stream, you can view the shout box comments from the listeners and DJs. The app is available for free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeforcode.radiohelsinki).

Give it a go and please let me know if there is anything you'd like me to improve!
